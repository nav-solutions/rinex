## Issue reporting

Thank you for using our library and trying to make it better 🛰️ 🌍

## Error reporting

When reporting an issue related to one of our libraries, an error log will suffice.

If your post-processing pipeline is complex and involves very specific data, it may be required
that you provide your input data so we can replicate the problem. To do so, contact us
through one of our portals and we have means to arrange that. If you are willing to do so,
you can directly submit your test data into our [dedicated repo](https://github.com/rtk-rs/data) 
and we can start replicating the issue right away.
