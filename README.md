[RINEX (Receiver Independent EXchange)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RINEX) parser and formatter.   
The RINEX format is fully open source and is specified to answer the requirements of navigation and much more.

## Advantages :rocket: 

- Fast
- Open sources: read and access all the code!
- All modern GNSS constellations, codes and signals
  - Surveying with GPS, Galileo, BeiDou and QZSS
- Time scales: GPST, QZSST, BDT, GST, UTC, TAI
- Efficient seamless compression and decompression
- RINEX V4 full support, including
  - new Ionospheric coorections
  - new Time offset corrections
  - precise Earth Orientation updates
- Navigation supported in the following constellations
  - GPS
  - Galileo
  - BeiDou
  - QZSS
- Most RINEX formats supported (see following table)
- High Precision Clock RINEX products (for PPP)
- DORIS (special RINEX)
- Many pre-processing algorithms including Filter Designer
- Several file operations: merging, splitting, time binning (batch)

## Warnings :warning:

- Navigation is currently not feasible with Glonass, SBAS and IRNSS
- File production might lack some features, mostly because we're currently focused on data processing

Formats & revisions
===================

The parser supports RINEX V4.0, that includes RINEX V4 Navigation files.   
We support the latest revisions for both IONEX and Clock RINEX.  
We support the latest (rev D) SP3 format.
